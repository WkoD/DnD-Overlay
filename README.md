# DnD-Overlay

A server based approach to transmit information for DnD games. The server offers a REST api and any client can send images to be displayed on any connected screen. Everything is still work in progress so expect bugs and broken features. Server and client via internet has not been tested so latency for big images could be really bad, as no form of compression is used.

Server and client have been tested with *Windows 10* only and **NOT** with *Linux* or *Mac-OS* as of yet.
